## Strengths
The essay provides a well-researched comparison of UML and SysML with strong supporting references, highlighting that UML primarily focuses on software engineering while SysML extends its capabilities to systems engineering (Weilkiens, 2011). The differentiation between the types of diagrams each language uses helps clarify their specific applications.

## Areas for Improvement
The introduction lacks focus and should include a concise overview to establish why comparing UML and SysML is relevant, setting a clearer scope for the reader (Dori, 2016). While the essay provides a basic comparison, it could delve deeper into practical implications, such as how SysML’s integration with tools like MagicDraw enhances real-world project simulations (Beery, 2016). The analysis would benefit from critical insights on the trade-offs of using SysML over UML, addressing potential challenges, such as its complexity for smaller teams (Zhang et al., 2022). Additionally, mentioning how SysML suits specific industries (e.g., aerospace or defense) would enrich the context (Friedenthal, 2018). The conclusion reiterates the differences but lacks synthesis; tying key points together would strengthen the impact and align with the assignment’s learning outcomes of critical analysis and solution evaluation.
