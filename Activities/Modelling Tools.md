# Comparing UML and SysML: Differences and Their Impact on Tool Choice for Systems Engineering

UML (Unified Modeling Language) and SysML (Systems Modeling Language) are both essential modeling tools, but they serve different purposes. UML is primarily focused on software modeling, whereas SysML is designed for systems engineering, covering both software and hardware. These differences make SysML the more suitable choice for systems engineering tasks, which involve complex multidisciplinary components.

## Scope

### UML
UML is tailored to represent software systems, focusing on the interactions between classes, objects, and processes. It is effective for modeling software architectures.

### SysML
SysML, as an extension of UML, provides additional tools to model systems engineering, including hardware, software, and human components. It includes diagrams such as requirements and parametric diagrams to support the modeling of system constraints, which are critical in complex systems (Wolny et al., 2020).

### Impact on Choice
SysML is better suited for systems engineering because it can model multidisciplinary systems, while UML is more appropriate for software-centric projects. SysML’s ability to handle broader system interactions makes it invaluable in industries like aerospace, automotive, and healthcare, where complex integrations are common.

## Focus

### UML
UML includes use case diagrams to model functional requirements, but it lacks a dedicated feature to track system requirements throughout the design and development process.

### SysML
SysML incorporates a requirements diagram, allowing engineers to model system requirements, link them to components, and ensure traceability throughout the system’s lifecycle (Chabibi et al., 2018).

### Impact on Choice
In systems engineering, where requirement traceability is crucial, SysML provides the necessary tools to ensure that all system components meet the required specifications. This makes SysML a superior choice over UML for systems where tracking and validating requirements is essential.

## Converting SysML Models to Executable Models

Chabibi et al. (2018) present a method for integrating SysML with MATLAB/Simulink by using a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) called SimulML. This integration allows engineers to convert high-level SysML models into simulation environments where system behaviors can be verified. The use of SimulML bridges the gap between descriptive models and executable simulations, enabling seamless transitions between system modeling and performance evaluation. By automating the transformation of SysML models into MATLAB/Simulink, the approach reduces the need for manual reconfiguration, improving the efficiency of simulation-based system testing (Chabibi et al., 2018).

Building on this, Kapos et al. (2021) propose a declarative approach using QVT-R (Query/View/Transformation-Relations) to transform SysML models into executable simulation models in a more standardized way. This approach is particularly useful for converting SysML models into frameworks like DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification), which are used to simulate and evaluate event-driven systems. Kapos et al. emphasize that this method adheres to Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) principles, ensuring that SysML models can be easily transitioned into executable simulations while maintaining consistency and reliability across different domains (Kapos et al., 2021).

## Where Would You Use This Feature and Which Type of Systems Is It Most Relevant To?

The ability to transform SysML models into executable simulations is invaluable in systems where extensive testing and validation are required before physical implementation. MATLAB/Simulink can be used to model and simulate dynamic systems, developing control strategies for complex systems such as robots, and even signal processing. This feature is particularly beneficial for:

- **Automotive Systems**: Simulating vehicle control systems, such as braking or acceleration, under various road conditions to ensure performance without needing costly physical prototypes (Chabibi et al., 2018).
- **Aerospace Systems**: Using simulations to model and validate the behavior of flight control systems or satellite operations to ensure reliability in different environmental conditions (Kapos et al., 2021).
- **Medical Devices**: Simulating devices like heart monitors or insulin pumps to ensure their functionality in diverse patient scenarios before real-world application (Wolny et al., 2020).
